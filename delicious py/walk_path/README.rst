Let us have a world where arr represents a list

arr = [
[0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,1,1,3,0],
[0,1,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,1,2,0],
[1,1,0,0,0,0]
]

given that 0 represents walls, 1 represents walking path, 2 represents the exit and 3 represents the player. print the shortest path to the exit in terms of coordinates
